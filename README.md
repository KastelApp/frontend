## Translating

If you want to help with translating the app, please let me say first of all thank you! We appreciate all the help we can get! Second we got a few ground rules for translating:

- Do not use Google Translate or any other translating software, We want the translations to be as accurate as possible
- Do not use any slang or any other language that is not professional
- Do not use any offensive language
- Do not translate these values: tags.\*, \_debug.\*, login.email.placeholder, register.email.placeholder, register.username.placeholder

Before your pull request is merged, we will verify the translations to make sure they are accurate and professional. You may also add your username & id to the contributors array in said file.
